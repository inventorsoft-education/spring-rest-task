# spring-boot-task
Home task to learn how to use Spring Boot

## Task description

Create application which delivers emails in future o_O. App should have console interface where user can input following data:
1) Recipient email;

2) Email subject;

3) Email body;

4) Delivery date;

  Delivery information should be persistent so that application can be restarted without data loss. Actual delivery should run in background thread.

**Technical details:** application should use Spring Boot and benefit from Dependency Injection. Data should be stored on filesystem without usage of database engine (you free to choose format). For actual email delivery, look for the appropriate Spring Boot starter.
